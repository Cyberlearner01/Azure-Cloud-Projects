# Lab 1: Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities
## Overview
This lab showcases how my ability to manage identities within Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory). Through this lab, I successfully replicated real-world scenarios for account user management, group administration, and security configurations, which are crucial for any organisation utilizing Azure.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Identity Management**: Created and managed user identities, which are fundamental for access control in cloud environments
- **Group Management**: Effectively managed security groups to control permissions and resource access for users
- **Security Configurations**: Configured Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security for user accounts, showcasing my commitmentto security best practices.

  ## Steps Taken
1. **User Creation**: Created several users accounts individually and also using the bulk operations to simulate a realistic environment for testing and management.
2. **Group Administration**: Established security groups to categorize users based on their roles and permissions within the organization.
3. **Role Assignments**: Assigned roles to users to ensure they have the appropriate access to resources.
4. **MFA Configuration**: Enabled MFA for all users to add an additional layer of security.

## Key Results
- Successfully created and managed **18** users and **3** groups within the Azure environment.
- Configured MFA for **15** users, significantly improving security measures.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
- Azure Portal

## Conclusion
This project highlights my capability to manage identities effectively within a cloud environment. These skills are essential for any IT role focusing on cloud technologies and security.
